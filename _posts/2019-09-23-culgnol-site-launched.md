Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. Wasn't as easy as I thought it would be, especially if you only started with the starter tutorial from Github ["Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll"](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#next-steps-configuring-jekyll). Jumped everywhere like the MDN docs.

Finally stumbled onto the Jekyll ["Github Pages"](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/#project-page-url-structure) doc, that recommended this guide Github should link to instead by Jonathan McGlone ["Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub"](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), gives good 10,000 ft view of using Jekyll with Github Pages.
